    Brave is a free and open-source web browser developed by Brave Software, Inc. based on the Chromium web browser. It blocks ads and website trackers, and provides a way for users to send cryptocurrency contributions in the form of Basic Attention Tokens to websites and content creators.

I use **Brave Browser** as my primary browser in MacOS and Linux Mint. I like it because it's fast, secure, and privacy-focused.
